                <p>
                  The match fees for the season can be paid in advance at the time of registration unless you agree to the conditions for weekly payment.
                </p>
                <p>Any teams wishing to pay weekly must agree to the following conditions:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
                  <li>Your VISA/Mastercard card information is stored on a secure server and no person has access to this information. The information is stored as a condition of entry into the competition.</li>
                  <li>Once the competition is confirmed you will be notified by email and the deposit (or full fee for one-day tournaments) will be taken from your card. This deposit will be used towards the match fees for the last games you play in the competition.</li>
                  <li>During the competition you will be required to pay the match/tournament fee on the day of your game, a failure to pay this match fee will result in the credit card being charged the applicable fee for that game/tournament.</li>
                  <li>As the team captain/manager it is your responsibility to ensure that the match fee is paid and by submitting the registration you are authorising Ultimate Soccer to charge your card in the event your team does not pay the match fee.</li>

                  <li>You are also liable to pay the match fee for forfeited games or in the event your team pulls out of the competition. Cancelling or forfeiting a fixture results in liability of the match fee along with 50% of the oppositions match fee.

Fees must be paid on the day of the forfeited league game, a failure to pay this fee will result in the credit card being charged the applicable fee for that league game and any forfeit fee.</li>
                  <li>A team pulling out of the competition once the league has been confirmed and fixtures have been sent but BEFORE the first game has been played will be liable for the fee of the first game and last two games of the competition. Not the full seasons fees.</li>
                  <li>In the event your team wishes to pull out of the competition you are liable for the match fees for your team for all remaining games.</li>

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mb-4">Competition Terms and Conditions</h3>
                <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 ml-4">
                  <li>The competition is conducted by Ultimate Football PTY LTD, 94 164 721 340 (Ultimate Soccer).</li>
                  <li>Ultimate Soccer requires and securely stores your credit card details as no payment is due or processed until the first game of the season, unless you consent to earlier payment.</li>
                  <li>A bond, which pays for the last two games of the season of $200 (5 a side) or $220 (7 a side) is payable by each team and can either: (a) be taken from your credit card or (b) alternatively paid in cash: (i) at the Ultimate Soccer venue at the time of registration or (ii) otherwise prior to the start of the season, if you and your team prefer to do so; or (iii) prior to the start of your team's first game of the season at reception of the Ultimate Soccer venue.</li>
                  <li>Prior to the start of each game, your team will be required to pay the fee for that game. The applicable fee per game and the total minimum price that is payable per season is outlined in the table attached as Schedule 1. Once the fee is paid for a game, your team will be provided with a token from reception that must be provided to the referee prior to the start of the game.</li>
                  <li>Unless you or your team notify us otherwise, you and your team also agree that your team will be automatically enrolled into the following season(s) and that your bond will automatically be rolled over and used as bond in such future season(s). If your team does not wish to continue for the next season, you or your team must notify us with at least 3 games remaining in the current season. If you or your team notify us prior to at least 3 games remaining in the current season that your team does not wish to continue for next season, your bond will be used as payment for your team's last 2 games in this season. If your team elects not to participate in the next season but you or your team do not provide notice as outlined in this paragraph (with at least 3 games remaining in the current season), your bond will be forfeited and will not be returned or refunded, however, neither you nor your team will be charged any other fees for that future season unless your team elects to play any game of that future season in which case you will be charged for that season.</li>
                  <li>Each team will have the right to 1 postponement per season, provided that at least 48 hours' notice is given to Ultimate Soccer. No further postponements will be allowed, and attempt to postpone under any other circumstances will be deemed a forfeiture.</li>
                  <li>Cancelling or forfeiting a game by your team will result in your team's liability for the fee for that game, and for 50% of the opposition's fee for that game. All such fees are payable prior to the following game.</li>
                  <li>Subject to clause 5, in the event your team wishes to pull out of the season your team will be liable for the game fees for your team for all remaining games in the season. Ultimate Soccer can try and replace your team in the competition and if successful, your team will no longer be liable for future fees from the date of such replacement.</li>
                  <li>You and your team agree that Ultimate Soccer has the right to charge your stored credit card for any fees incurred due to an additional or unauthorised postponement, cancellation, forfeiture, pull out or non payment of any fees by your team.</li>
                  <li>You and your team agree that 4 teams will proceed into finals based on the results during the season. The fee applicable to teams playing finals games is a flat fee per team covering all finals games, as listed in Schedule 1, and is payable prior to your team's first game in the finals. For clarity, the fee applicable to usual season games will not be applicable to the finals (only the flat finals fee will apply). Clauses 7 and 9 apply equally to finals games as they apply to season games.</li>
                  <li>You accept, and you warrant that all your team members accept, all risks necessarily flowing from your participation in the competition. Accordingly, to the extent permitted by law, your and your team members release all persons or corporations associated directly or indirectly with the conduct of the competition from all claims, demands and proceedings arising out of your and your team member's participation and you hereby indemnify them against all liability (including liability for their negligence and the negligence of others) for all injury, loss or damage arising out of or connected with your and your team member's participation in the competition. This release shall extend to Ultimate Soccer and their respective related bodies corporate, directors, partners, managers, officers, agents, contractors, employees and volunteers, the owners, licensees and occupiers/owners of land and buildings upon which the competition or any part of it is conducted on or any other person or business which is involved directly or indirectly with the competition in any manner whatsoever. This release and indemnity continues forever and binds our heirs, executors, personal representative and assignees.</li>
                  <li>If any part of these Terms and Conditions is held to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, such part will be excluded to the extent necessary and the remainder of the provisions will still apply.</li>
                  <li>By signing below, you consent to these Terms and Conditions on your own behalf and on behalf of your team members (who you warrant have each consented to you doing so).</li>

                <p>
                  When you compete in our leagues at Ultimate soccer it is a condition of entry that you behave in a manner appropriate. Ultimate Soccer values the atmosphere we have created and operate in, whilst we are aware that we conduct a business which involves competitive soccer we also believe it is important for this to be played out in a healthy, safe and enjoyable environment. Our key drivers for the staff, players and spectators are based on Respect, Dignity and Responsibility to create the Ultimate Soccer Experience. Therefore we will not tolerate the following:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
                  <li>Any disrespect shown towards another participant at Ultimate Soccer.</li>
                  <li>Consumption of alcohol at the venue or intoxicated peoples on Ultimate Soccer grounds.</li>
                  <li>Descent towards the referee, in a physical, verbal or visual manner.</li>
                  <li>Abuse to another person at the venue (referee, other player, spectator or staff member) both verbal or physical.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  If any of the above is committed Ultimate Soccer reserve the right to ban individuals for a length of time determined by the Facility Manager based on the individual circumstance. We promote fair play, good behaviour and acts of good nature at Ultimate Soccer and wish for all of the Players and Spectators to leave after every experience with a smile on their face, a wow in their mind and a little bit of love in their heart.
